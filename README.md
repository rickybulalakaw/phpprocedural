This repository contains files for demonstration on building a web app using Procedural PHP.

The app assumes there is an existing mysql, PHP and web server such as Apache2 or NGINX.

The SQL file is in config folder. You will need to import this in your MySQL database for the app to work. Make sure to designate yourself as Admin in the users table by changing the usertype as "Admin" so that you can activate other users, particularly those that have validated their link. For the exercise, you can just edit the function.

Make sure to the name of the database in your config/db.php file is the same as the name of your database in MySQL.
